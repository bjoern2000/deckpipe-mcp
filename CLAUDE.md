# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Deckpipe is an agent-first slide deck rendering engine. Agents author each slide as HTML/CSS/JS (the `canvas` layout); Deckpipe renders it inside a sandboxed shadow root, themes it via deck-level CSS variables, and gives every deck a shareable viewer URL with built-in commenting. Three packages in a Node.js/TypeScript monorepo.

As of Deckpipe 0.3, `canvas` is the only agent-facing layout. The 25 templated layouts from 0.2 still exist in the codebase and the REST API still accepts them — see "Resurrecting deprecated layouts" below for the resurrection path.

## Commands

```bash
# Dev setup (local Postgres must be running)
npm install
npm run db:migrate          # Run SQL migrations

# Development
npm run dev                 # API + Viewer concurrently
npm run dev:api             # API only (port from .env, currently 3010)
npm run dev:viewer          # Vite dev server (port 5173, proxies /v1/* to API)
# Build
npm run build               # All packages (shared must build first)
npm run build:shared        # Just shared (others depend on it)
```

## Architecture

**`packages/shared`** — Zod schemas, TypeScript types, ID generators, error types. Every other package depends on this. `schema.ts` defines the discriminated union of slide layouts (`canvas` plus 25 deprecated templated layouts kept for backward compatibility) and is the single source of truth for the data model. Deck-level `stylesheet` and `head` fields live here too.

**`packages/mcp-core`** — MCP tool definitions (`registerTools(server, { apiUrl })`), `INSTRUCTIONS` constant, deprecated-layout list. Single source of truth shared by the remote MCP (mounted inside the API at `/mcp`) and the standalone npm package (`deckpipe-mcp`). If you're updating a tool description or parameter schema, this is the only file you touch.

**`packages/api`** — Express REST API on `/v1/decks` and `/v1/images`, plus the remote MCP transport at `/mcp` that calls `registerTools` from `@deckpipe/mcp-core`. PostgreSQL with JSONB for slide data plus `stylesheet TEXT` and `head JSONB` columns. Image uploads stored to disk at `IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH`. External image URLs in slides are automatically re-hosted on deck creation. Rate limiting per-endpoint. The REST API still accepts all layouts so legacy decks remain editable.

**`packages/viewer`** — Lit web components. `viewer-app.ts` is the top-level shell (deck loading, navigation state, edit mode, auto-save, head-entry injection). `slide-renderer.ts` is a factory that routes `layout` to a component — `canvas` → `<slide-canvas>` (open shadow root, adopts deck stylesheet + slide css, runs slide js on enter), everything else → the legacy `<slide-*>` components. Slide dimensions computed via ResizeObserver to fit 16:9 in available space.

**`packages/mcp`** — Standalone MCP server published to npm as `deckpipe-mcp`. Stdio transport for local agents (`npx deckpipe-mcp`), HTTP transport when `PORT` is set. Pure transport plumbing — all tool logic lives in `@deckpipe/mcp-core`. Configured via `DECKPIPE_API_URL` env var (defaults to `https://deckpipe.dev`).

## Key Patterns

- **Canvas slide**: `{ layout: "canvas", content: { html (required), css?, js?, static_render_only? } }`. `<slide-canvas>` mounts the html into an open shadow root, adopts (deck.stylesheet + slide.css) via `adoptedStyleSheets`, and runs `js` on enter with `(root, slide)` in scope.
- **Slide schema**: Discriminated union on `layout` field. `canvas` is the only advertised layout; the 25 legacy layouts (`title`, `title_and_bullets`, `stats`, `chart`, etc.) are still in the union so old decks render and the REST API stays compatible. The MCP surface forces new content to `canvas`.
- **PATCH semantics**: Index-based partial slide updates with deep merge: `{ slides: [{ index: 2, content: { html: "<div>…</div>" } }] }`. Top-level `title`/`stylesheet`/`head` updates supported. Structural changes via `slide_operations` array (insert, delete, move, replace) — executed sequentially before content edits. The REST API also accepts legacy `heading_font`/`body_font` updates for decks that were created with those fields set (see "Fonts" below); the MCP surface no longer exposes them.
- **Viewer edit flow (canvas)**: `<slide-canvas>` walks the shadow root, marks text-bearing leaf elements (`h1`, `p`, `span`, …) as `contenteditable` when `editable` is true. On `focusout`, the full cleaned `innerHTML` is emitted via `slide-content-changed` with field `'html'`; `viewer-app` debounces (1s) and PATCHes. Legacy `<slide-*>` components retain their per-field contenteditable flow.
- **Commenting (canvas)**: On mount, `<slide-canvas>` translates `data-dp-anchor="<name>"` → `data-content-path="anchor:<name>"` for stable anchors, then walks every other element depth-first and assigns `data-content-path="auto:<index>"`. The existing `comment-layer` walker descends into the open shadow root and uses smallest-area hit-testing. Anchors survive structural edits; `auto:*` paths only survive within a render.
- **Print mode**: `?print` query param renders all slides stacked with page breaks, no chrome. Used by Puppeteer for PDF export. Canvas slides with `static_render_only: true` skip their `js` in print.
- **Presenter mode**: Fullscreen presentation via "Present" button. Keyboard nav (arrows, spacebar, Escape). Cursor auto-hides after 3s inactivity. Black background, no chrome.
- **Fonts**: New decks load fonts via `head` entries (Google Fonts `<link>`s) and set `font-family` in `stylesheet`. The legacy `heading_font` / `body_font` deck fields still exist in the schema, DB, REST API, and viewer — when present they get forwarded into shadow roots as `--dp-font-heading` / `--dp-font-body` CSS custom properties — so older decks render unchanged. The MCP surface (as of 0.3.5) no longer advertises those fields; agents author typography directly via `head` + `stylesheet`.

## Headless rendering & screenshots

Two MCP tools rely on a Puppeteer pipeline that renders slides through the real viewer:

- `preview_slide` (transient): `POST /v1/preview` stashes a `{ html, css, js, stylesheet?, head? }` payload in an in-memory map keyed by `pv_<uuid>` (60s TTL). The headless browser hits `${viewerUrl}/preview/<uuid>?screenshot=1`. The viewer detects `/preview/...` paths and fetches `/v1/preview/<uuid>` instead of `/v1/decks/<id>`. After the screenshot lands the payload is deleted.
- `get_slide_screenshot`: `GET /v1/decks/:id/slides/:slideIndex/screenshot` renders the slide via `${viewerUrl}/d/<deck_id>?screenshot=1&slide=<n>` and caches the result at `${IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH}/screenshots/<deck_id>-<slide_index>-<updated_at_ms>.png` plus a sibling `.report.json`. Cache invalidates automatically because `deck.updated_at` changes on every PATCH.

The Puppeteer browser is a module-level singleton in `packages/api/src/services/render.ts` (`getBrowser()`). Each request gets a new page; the browser is reused across requests and closed gracefully on `SIGTERM`. The render report (`js_errors`, `console_errors`, `overflows`, `fonts_loaded/missing`, `failed_requests`) is collected by listening to `pageerror`/`console`/`requestfailed` plus a `page.evaluate` overflow walker that descends shadow roots.

The viewer signals readiness by setting `<html data-ready="true">` after `document.fonts.ready` + two rAFs. Both `?print` and `?screenshot=1` modes do this; the renderer waits up to 12s for it.

## Resurrecting deprecated layouts

The 25 templated layouts from 0.2 (`title`, `title_and_bullets`, `stats`, `chart`, `swot`, `quadrant`, `venn_diagram`, `comparison`, `timeline`, `code`, `callout`, `icons_and_text`, `team`, `embed`, `pros_and_cons`, `agenda`, `swot`, `closing`, `title_and_body`, `title_and_table`, `two_columns`, `section_break`, `image_and_text`, `image_gallery`, `quote`, `full_image`) are still fully implemented:

- `packages/shared/src/schema.ts` — content schemas + the discriminated union entries
- `packages/viewer/src/components/slide-*.ts` — Lit components for each
- `packages/viewer/src/components/slide-renderer.ts` — routing switch
- `packages/api/src/utils/slide-warnings.ts` — content field validation
- `docs/mcp-agent-instructions.md` — review-friendly text

What changed in 0.3 is the **agent-facing MCP surface**. Specifically:

- `packages/api/src/routes/mcp.ts` and `deckpipe-mcp/src/index.ts` both narrow `create_deck.slides[].layout` and `slide_operations.slide.layout` to `z.literal('canvas')`.
- `list_layouts` returns only `canvas` plus a `deprecated_layouts` block.
- The `INSTRUCTIONS` and `create_deck`/`update_deck` descriptions document canvas only.

To bring the templated layouts back into the agent-facing surface:

1. In both `mcp.ts` files, re-import `LayoutNames` from `@deckpipe/shared` and swap the two `z.literal('canvas')` calls back to `z.enum(LayoutNames)`. Restore the `content: z.record(z.unknown())` shape.
2. Restore the full 25-layout listing in `list_layouts` (the data is preserved in git history pre-0.3.1, or reconstruct from the `slide-*.ts` components and `slide-warnings.ts`).
3. Update the `INSTRUCTIONS` constant to describe the templated layouts again.
4. Mirror in `docs/mcp-agent-instructions.md`.

Nothing else needs to change — the schema, viewer components, and REST API are unchanged.

## MCP tool definitions — single source

All MCP tool descriptions, parameter schemas, and the server instructions string live in **one place**: `packages/mcp-core/src/index.ts`. Both the remote MCP server (mounted at `/mcp` by `packages/api`) and the standalone npm package (`packages/mcp`, published as `deckpipe-mcp`) import `registerTools(server, { apiUrl })` and `INSTRUCTIONS` from `@deckpipe/mcp-core`.

When you update an MCP tool:
1. Edit `packages/mcp-core/src/index.ts`.
2. Bump the `MCP_VERSION` in `packages/api/src/routes/mcp.ts` and the `version` in `packages/mcp/src/index.ts` + `packages/mcp/package.json` + `packages/mcp-core/package.json` if the change is user-facing.
3. Mirror any agent-facing copy changes to `docs/mcp-agent-instructions.md` (review-friendly markdown copy).

There is no second file to keep in sync.

### Publishing `deckpipe-mcp` to npm

`packages/mcp` uses esbuild (`build.mjs`) to bundle `@deckpipe/mcp-core` inline into `dist/index.js` — the published tarball has no workspace specifier and runtime deps are limited to `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod`. `prepublishOnly` builds mcp-core first, then runs the bundle.

```bash
npm run -w packages/mcp build     # produces self-contained dist/index.js
cd packages/mcp && npm publish    # prepublishOnly handles the chain
```

To smoke-test the published artifact without actually publishing: `npm pack /path/to/packages/mcp` and `npm install` the resulting tarball in a scratch directory.
